// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
//  If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file.
//  Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

let person_Name = " \n\t Sara \t"//whitespace characters are added to the value of the variable
console.log(person_Name)
console.log(person_Name.trim())//.trim method is used to remove extra whitespaces.

let  newName = "Sara"
console.log("Hello"  +  newName  + "would you like to learn some Python today?")//printed a sentence using concatenation
